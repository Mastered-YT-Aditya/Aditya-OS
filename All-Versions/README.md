Here are all versions of Aditya OS as a .sb3 file. You can open them using Scratch 3.0 or TurboWarp.
Install Scratch 3.0: https://scratch.mit.edu/download to run those files.

But from version 1.4.3, you cannot open those .sb3 files on Scratch. Those files only open them using TurboWarp.
Download TurboWarp: https://desktop.turbowarp.org

If use, give me credits! ;)
